Specifics Breakdown & Roadblocks:

	!!!TILE RENDERING!!!

	- Main priority to learn is a tile based system.  Need to get that working before moving on.
		- Simplify as much as possible, use colored rectangles and pixels rather than images.
		
		Have a pixel array render the entire screen in the display class.  Have tiles be individually rendered.
		
		Classes:

			- Display
			- Tile (abstract)
			- "Specific Tiles"
